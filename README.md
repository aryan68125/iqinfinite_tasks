# packages : 
Creating and using packages are covered.  
The following packages that are created and then used in main.py file are as follows : 
1. drivers
2. dictionary
3. list_custom [List comprehension]
4. loop [break, continue, range]
5. operators
6. sets
7. strings [regex library]
8. tuples   

# classes, constructors, (getters and setters), methods, private variables, __private methods, Abstraction , Type casting:
[Classes,constructors, (getters and setters), methods, Abstraction, Type casting] have been used in all the files inside packages as listed below : 
1. drivers
2. dictionary
3. list_custom [List comprehension]
4. loop [break, continue, range]
5. operators
6. sets
7. strings [regex library]
8. tuples  

# Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Class variables:
[Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Class variables] have been used in the solution.py file inside a class_oop folder :  
NOTE: class_oop is not a package it's just a folder
1. solution.py

# magic methods:
Magic methods are those methods that can't be created by us but we can use them to create some new things to meet our requirements for example creating a fraction datatype:
used in Operator package in files as listed below : 
1. fraction  
2. fraction_calculator (used this fraction datatype in here) 

# conditional statements, loops [break, range] and Exceptions: 
Conditional statements are used to drive menu driven programs
the files where conditional statements are used are listed below : 
### Stand alone files
1. main.py [Python Exceptions]
### Packages : 
A. drivers : files inside this package uses conditional statements and loops to drive the menu system :
1. driver_dictionary
2. driver_list
3. driver_loop
4. driver_operator
5. driver_sets
6. driver_string
7. driver_tuples  
  
B. operators : files inside this package uses conditional statements and loops to drive the menu system :
1. calculator
2. fraction_calculator
3. unit_converter

# generators : 
generator folder is not a package it's a simple folder that contains some examples of generators: 
1. example_0
2. example_1
3. example_2

# args and kwargs : 
args_kwargs folder holds the programs related to args and kwargs:
args_akwargs :
1. example_0
2. example_1
A. args  
1. example_1
2. example_2
3. example_3
B. kwargs
1. example1
2. example2
3. example3
