The following packages that are created and then used in main.py file are as follows : 
1. drivers
2. dictionary
3. list_custom [List comprehension]
4. loop [break, continue, range]
5. operators
6. sets
7. strings [regex library]
8. tuples   

# classes, constructors, (getters and setters), methods, private variables, __private methods, Abstraction , Type casting:

2. dictionary
3. list_custom [List comprehension]
4. loop [break, continue, range]
5. operators

# Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Class variables:
[Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Class variables] have been used in the solution.py file inside a class_oop folder :  
NOTE: class_oop is not a package it's just a folder
1. solution.py

# magic methods:
Magic methods are those methods that can't be created by us but we can use them to create some new things to meet our requirements for example creating a fraction datatype:
used in Operator package in files as listed below : 
1. fraction  
2. fraction_calculator (used this fraction datatype in here) 

# conditional statements, loops [break, range] and Exceptions: 
Conditional statements are used to drive menu driven programs
the files where conditional statements are used are listed below : 
### Stand alone files
1. main.py 
### Packages :

1. driver_dictionary 
2. driver_list
3. driver_loop
4. driver_operator
5. driver_sets
6. driver_string
7. driver_tuples  
  
B. operators : files inside this package uses conditional statements and loops to drive the menu system :
1. calculator
2. fraction_calculator
3. unit_converter
